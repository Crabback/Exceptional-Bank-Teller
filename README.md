# Exceptional-Bank-Teller

In this assignment, we are going to implement a bank teller application to allow customers to
access bank accounts through a unique identification. Using this teller application, a customer
can complete any of the following transactions:
• withdraw money,
• deposit money,
• query account balances, and
• see the most recent 5 transactions.
